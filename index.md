## Welcome to my new site

### Dont' expect to see anything fascinating here yet!

I'll use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/alexandershedden/github-pages-with-jekyll/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

[My Main Company site can be found here - it too, is a work in progress](http://aicontact.com) and ![Here is a picture of a puppy - only joking!](src)

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alexandershedden/github-pages-with-jekyll/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
